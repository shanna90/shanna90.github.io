<h2>Inputing Your Graph</h2>
<p>Graphs can be created using one of two methods: an edge equation, or an adjacency matrix</p>
<h3>Equation Input</h3>
<p>If you chose to define your graph by equation, you will need to first define your nodes. This is done in terms
of 'n'. The expression you enter into this box will be evaluated for n=0 to n=(number of nodes-1). For example,
if you specify 5 nodes, and you wish to have a node for each even number, you would enter the expression '2*n', 
and the program will return the nodes: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. These node values, not 'n', will also be used to evaluate the edge
definition. The edge definition uses 'a' on the left side of the equation, and 'b' on the right side. Each 
combination of node values (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in our example), will be inserted into 'a' and 'b', and if the equation
evaluates to true, then an edge is drawn. For directed graphs, indicated by a checkbox, the arrow points from 'a'
to 'b'. For example, if our edge equation is "a=b*2" and Directed Graph is checked, then 8 would point to 4, 4 would
 point to 2, 6 would not be connected
to any other nodes, and 0 would point to itself. All edges in the graph are assigned a length of 1. If you wish to
differentiate edge lengths, please use the matrix input. Also, please note that all multiplication must be explicit 
(2*n, not 2n)
<h3>Matrix Input</h3>
<p>If you chose to define your graph by matrix, you will first specify the number of nodes. and then click 
"Define Graph by Matrix". A grid of inputs will appear. The first column allows you to enter labels for each node. 
The 'x's along the diagonal of the matrix prevent self referencing nodes, but can be over-ridden. To create an
edge between two nodes, enter a number on the line of the originating node, in the column of the destination node. 
For example if your nodes are labeled 'a', 'b', 'c', and you want an edge of length 2 from 'a' to 'b', you would 
enter a 2 in the first row (the row for 'a') in the second column (since 'b' is the second node). Note that the
default is a directed graph. To make it undirected, you would also need to enter the 2 in the second row 
(the row for 'b') in the first column (since 'a' is the first node). </p>
<h2>Rendering your Graph</h2>
<p> Once you have entered your graph definition, click "Render". It will appear in a box below the buttons. 
The nodes are arranged randomly, but can be moved around using click and drag. You can also zoom in and out
by using the scroll wheel on your mouse or pinching in an out on a touch-screen. Once the graph is displayed, 
new analysis buttons will appear.</p>
<h2>Analysis Options</h2>
<h3>Eulerian</h3>
<p>An Eulerian graph is one where there exists a path that uses each edge once and only once. If you click 
"Eulerian", your graph will be searched for such a path and return it's findings below the graph. Please note
that to run this analysis, your graph must have at least 3 edges. Any less is considered trivial.
<h3>Hamiltonian</h3>
<p>A Hamiltonian graph is one where there exists a cycle that visits each node once and only once. It is also
known as the "Traveling Salesman Problem". This function, when used on an undirected graph, will find the 
shortest Hamiltonian cycle, taking into consideration edge lengths. On an undirected graph, it will check for 
a Hamiltonian cycle that starts with the first node. The result will appear below the graph. The first
number is the length of the cycle, and the array of numbers indicates the order each vertex is visited,
with 0 being the first vertex you defined, and 1 being the second, etc.</p>
<h3>Vertex Coloring</h3>
<p>This button will render a copy of your graph where each node is colored 
in such a way that no two adjacent nodes 
share the same color. It does not guarentee the most efficient coloring, but rather no more than
one more color than the most efficient coloring.</p>
<h3>Edge Coloring</h3>
<p>This button will render a copy of your graph where each edge is colored
 in such a way that no vertex has two edges radiating from it of the same color. Like
 vertex coloring, the coloring guarentees to use no more than one color more than the 
 most efficient coloring.</p>
 <h3>Girth</h3>
 <p>The girth of a graph is the length of its smallest non-trivial cycle. Non-trivial in a 
 directed graph means at least 3 (you can't visit one adjacent node then simply return). In 
 a directed graph, non-trivial is at least 2 (you can visit one adjecent node then return
 if there is such a path). The girth is displayed below the graph.</p>
 <h3>Valency</h3>
 <p>The valency of a graph is the maximum number of edges any node has. The valency is 
 displayed below the graph</p>
 <h2>A Note on Processing</h2>
 <p>This program depends on the processing power of your system. Where possible, 
 algorithms have been chosen to reduce processing time, but many of these analyses
 are proven NP-complete problems, so for larger graphs, be patient. <p>
